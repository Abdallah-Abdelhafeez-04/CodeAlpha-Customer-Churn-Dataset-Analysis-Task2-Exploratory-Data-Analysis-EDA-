# Project Title : 
Customer Churn Analysis

# Overview :
This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a telecommunications customer dataset to understand the factors influencing customer churn. By analyzing key features such as call duration, charges, and service plans, the project aims to identify patterns and insights that can help a business reduce customer attrition and improve retention strategies.The analysis is structured to provide actionable insights for decision-makers. It includes a series of questions that guide the data exploration and visualization process, revealing correlations and trends that are essential for developing effective churn prevention strategies.

# Workflow :
The analysis follows a standard data science workflow:

Data Loading: The churn-bigml-20.csv dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The notebook explores the dataset to understand its structure, identify data types, and check for missing values.

Question-Driven Analysis: The core of the analysis involves answering a series of meaningful questions. This includes:

Calculating the overall churn rate.

Analyzing the impact of service plans (e.g., international plan, voice mail plan) on churn.

Investigating the relationship between call minutes, charges, and churn.

Examining the correlation between customer service calls and churn likelihood.

Visualization: Charts are generated to visualize key findings, making them easy to interpret and share.


# How to Use :
Clone the repository
Go to Google Colab
Open the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook "CodeAlpha Second Task.ipynb"
Run all cells to execute the complete workflow
The code will run, and any output (like the chart and print statements) will appear directly below the cell.


# Technologies Used
Python: The core language for data manipulation and analysis.

Pandas: Used for efficient data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.

Jupyter Notebook: The interactive environment used for a step-by-step analysis and visualization.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: (Anticipated) For creating informative visualizations such as histograms and bar charts to present findings.
